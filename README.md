## What does it do?

**ediarum.DB** is an xar-Package for exist-db (https://github.com/eXist-db/exist). 
It is tested on exist-db version 3.5 and 4.4. With the help of
ediarum.DB administrators can configure exist-db as central database for ediarum.
So, different services and APIs can be set up, and XML resources can be stored and accessed
for editing.
